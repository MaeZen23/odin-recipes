      <h4><em>Soft and delicate dinner rolls for every occasion!</em></h4>
      <p>These super soft dinner rolls are a perfect addition to any meal, as a side dish or mains.</p>
      <p>If you are not experienced in making bread or rolls, then this recipe is perfect for you. Quick, simple, easy to make. And still delicious!</p>
      <p>Use a mixer with a dough hook to knead the dough, or you can knead by hand if you prefer.</p>
      <p>Tips for a successful dough: Make sure your yeast is fresh, accurately measure your flour, and don't over (or under) knead. When the dough's texture become elastic, you know its ready.</p>
      <p>You can use all-purpose flour or bread flour for this recipe. Bread flour will produce a chewier texture.</p>
      <p>One more thing: Leave it to rise for a good amount of time but remember to flatten before final shaping!</p>
      <p><em>Here's how to make it:</em></p>
    
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p><ul>
            <li>1C Whole milk, warmed to about 43°C</li>
            <li>2¼tsp Yeast</li>
            <li>2Tblsp Granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 Large egg</li>
            <li>¼C Unsalted butter, softened and cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1tsp Salt</li>
            <li>3C All-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
            <li>Optional topping: 2Tblsp Melted butter mixed with 1Tblsp Honey</li>
      </ul></p>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <p><strong>Prep the dough:</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>Whisk warm milk, yeast, and 1Tblsp sugar together in a bowl. Cover and allow to sit for 5 mins. </li>
            <li>Add remaining sugar, egg, butter, salt, and 1C flour. With dough hook or paddle attachment, beat on low speed for 30 seconds, scrape the sides of the bowl, add remaining flour. Beat on medium until dough comes together and pulls away from the side of the bowl (about 2 mins). If the dough seems too wet to knead, add more flour, 1 Tblsp at a time, until you have a workable dough. Dough should be soft and a little sticky but still manageable to knead with lightly floured hands.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><strong>Knead the dough</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional full 5 mins or knead by hand for a full 5 mins.</li> 
            <li>If dough becomes too sticky, sprinkle work surface or bowl with flour, 1Tblsp at a time; to make a slightly tacky, soft dough. Do not add more flour than needed as the dough will become dry.</li>
            <li>Poke it with your finger. If it bounces back slowly, it's ready to prove.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><strong>1st Rise</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>Lightly grease large bowl with oil or non-stick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning to coat on all sides.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil/plastic wrap/clean kitchen towel.</li>
            <li>Allow to rise in warm place for 1 to 2 hours, or until double in size.</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan or two 9 inch pans. You can also bake them in a cast iron skillet or on a lined baking sheet.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><strong>Shape the rolls</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>When the dough is ready, punch it down to release the air. </li>
            <li>Divide into 14 equal pieces.</li>
            <li>Shape each piece into a smooth ball and arrange in prepared pan.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><strong>2nd Rise</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>Cover shaped rolls. Allow to rise until puffy - about 1 hour.</li>
      </ol></p>
      <p><strong>Bake the rolls</strong></p>
      <p><ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to lower position and preheat oven to 350ºF (or about 177ºC)</li>
            <li>Bake rolls for 20-25 minutes or until golden brown on top, rotating the pan halfway through. If the rolls brown too quickly, loosely tent the pan with foil.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, brush with optional honey butter, and allow to cool for a bit before serving.</li>
      </ol></p>
