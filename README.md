Odin project recipe website lesson
In this project, I aim to create a working recipe website. 
I have been learning through the Odin project, 
and have completed all the lessons to this point. 
I have learnt to create html pages, and to use css to make them look nice. 
I have learnt to change heading attributes, body attributes,
add links and images. 
I hope to be able to demonstrate these at the end of this mini project.
