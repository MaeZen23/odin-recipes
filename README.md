Odin project recipe website lesson


In this project, I aim to create a working recipe website. 
I have been learning through the Odin project, 
and have completed all the lessons to this point. 
I have learnt to create html pages, and to use css to make them look nice. 
I have learnt to change heading attributes, body attributes,
add links and images. 
I hope to be able to demonstrate these at the end of this mini project. 

End of project: 

I have learned that it's important to check for things like typos and code errors before making any commits to git.
I have learned to add commit messages to my commits.
I have learned to compare pages to ensure uniformity across the site.

website updated for the exercise under The Cascade in CSS Foundation. Here I have changed the following:

1. I didn't think of citing my sources for the recipes before. I have now done that and added links.
2. Improved the headings and subheadings.
3. Improved the general layouts.
4. Added backgrounds for each page, with the sources cited and links added.
4. Added a return to index link at the bottom of each page.
4. neatened up the html and css.
